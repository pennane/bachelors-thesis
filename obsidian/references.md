The object oriented way
Christopher Okhrafi

"Why objects? I believe that the functional way is superior to the object oriented way. So why study
objects? Before we criticise the other side, we must understand their arguments better than they do
themselves. This book is my attempt at steel-manning the object oriented way, once and for all."

Is reduce() bad? - HTTP 203

"more mental overhead" "just make it into a loop"
"You can write functional code in JavaScript, but it's not functional programming by nature or by design."
"JAKE ARCHIBALD: Yeah, so readability is tangible.
11.20
It's subjective, but it's tangible.
11.22
You can look at two things and go, that's the one I prefer.
11.25
Performance is tangible, right?
11.28
SURMA: Even measurable.

Category Theory 1.1: Motivation and Philosophy

18:28 So Category Theory is this higher-level language above Haskell, above functional programming, above ML, Haskell, Scala, and so on C++, assembly, it's a higher-level language, okay? It's not a practical language that we can write code in, but it's a language.
So just like people who write these horrible metaprogramming template libraries in C++
19.48
they can only do this because they learned a little bit of Haskell.
19.54
and they know what some constructs in Haskell are and how to do things – how to implement algorithms on immutable data structures right
20.06
they know how to do this because they learned it from Haskell and they just translated into this horrible template programming language.

Category Theory 2.1: Functions, epimorphisms

Every time you design a language you have
0.58
to provide semantics for the language right? What does it mean, certain things in language and a lot of languages are
1.06
defined using so-called operational semantics i mean the ones who actually
1.11
have semantics, right. There are very few of them, none of the major ones. But they sort of like, have part of its semantics
